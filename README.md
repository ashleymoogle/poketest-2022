### Context
A client wants us to make an app that displays pokemons and allows a user to add one to its team but unfortunately some things are not working properly or are really, really, bad!

That's where you come in! I choose you (!!!) to fix these issues and implement what you think is best for the client need.
Here is a ***sample*** list of things that needs doing but ultimately it's your decision as to what to tackle first.

- We need to fix the obvious bugs and errors
- We want to get the pokemons from an api (https://pokeapi.co/), the first generation is what we want (151 first)
- We want a new layout for the pokemon list
- We want individual views for each pokemon with more data
- We want to be able to switch between the shiny version and the normal versions sprites on each individual views
- We want a view of the selected team with some basic infos on each selected team member
- We want to be able to access each team members view easily with the bottom bar and have a way (UX wise) to have some relevant infos without clicking on it
- We want a view where each pokemon is filtered by type, better yet, we want to be able to filter by types on the home page
- Spring clean the view and have a decent, usable UI
